Subject: SEO Optimization Completed - SWEETSTEVIAM Website

Dear [Client Name],

We have completed SEO optimizations for your SWEETSTEVIAM website. Summary:

**Completed Work:**
- Optimized meta titles, descriptions, and keywords (PL & EN versions)
- Enhanced H1 headings and added LocalBusiness structured data
- Expanded homepage content with 600+ SEO-optimized words
- Added FAQ schema and internal linking structure
- Updated sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and hreflang tags
- Clean URL structure with proper 301 redirects
- Added new SEO-optimized blog post: "Stewia vs Erytrytol vs Ksylitol" (PL & EN versions)

**Monitoring:**
You can track performance in Google Search Console under the "Performance" section. The site is performing well for long-tail keywords such as "stewia hurt" and "stewia hurt polska" where visibility is good.

Note: Ranking for the single keyword "stevia" will be challenging due to strong competition from larger, established companies. Our focus on location-specific and industry-focused keywords positions your site to attract qualified B2B traffic from food manufacturers.

All changes are ready for production. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
